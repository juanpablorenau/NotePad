# <span style="color:blue">NotePad: Build your iOS app in compose</span>

## Description

**NotePad** is a note-taking app that combines the simplicity and efficiency of the iOS Notes app with the power and customization capabilities of Android. Designed to cater to both basic and advanced users, FlexNote allows you to organize your ideas, lists, and projects intuitively while personalizing every detail to match your unique style.

## Features

The application has been built following these principles and patterns:

- **Compose**: The application is designed with compose.
- **Clean Architecture**: The application follows the Clean Architecture principle to separate responsibilities into different layers, which facilitates code maintenance and scalability.
- **Repository Pattern**: The Repository Pattern is used to abstract the data access logic, allowing data sources to be changed without affecting the rest of the application.
- **MVVM**: The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is used to separate the user interface logic from the business logic.
- **Hilt Dependency injection**: Allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source, rather than creating them internally. 
- **Flows**: Flows are used to handle user interface events asynchronously.
- **Coroutines**: Coroutines are used to handle asynchronous operations and improve the efficiency of the application.
- **Room**: Room is used for data persistence in the application.
- **Animations**: They create a more polished and engaging interface, making interactions intuitive and enjoyable for users
